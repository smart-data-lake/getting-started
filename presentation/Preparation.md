Welcome! Please follow the steps outlined in this document to complete the technical set-up of the Smart Data Lake Builder (SDLB). 

## What you will need

The following technical requirements are needed in order to participate in the training. Your system may already have some of these installed:
- Java / JDK 11 (or newer) --> The SDLB is a framework programmed in Scala and it runs on the Java Virtual Machine.
- Maven --> Used to build the application with all its dependencies
